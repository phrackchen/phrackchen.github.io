 I'm a final year undergraduate student in the <a href="https://en.sist.ustc.edu.cn" target="_blank">School of Information Science and Technology</a> at <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> University of Science and Technology of China</a>


## Research Experience

After joined the research project Human Face Sketch to Image, research opens me a new beautiful world: every work I have learned inspired and delighted me that, every time I finished reading a famous paper, I had a feeling just like finish watching a movie with a great story. What I did in this project is training and evaluating current models, and developed a method to evaluate the generated images trained on a large dataset CelebA with multi-labels, which equipped me with a deeper understanding of neural networks and data preprocessing. Meanwhile, motivated by my deep interest in Style Transfer, I made a thorough survey in this field and shared my understanding with the seniors through a lecture, brought fresh blood to our lab.

This summer vacation, I went to the University of Sydney as an intern to start my Style Transfer project targeted at specific artists under the supervision of Prof. Dacheng Tao. In this project, I developed a generative adversarial based model that can benefit from more than one style image and imitate the style of famous painters, in which the encoder was trained using deep clustering method to avoid collapse. Firstly, to fit the deep clustering method for the unsupervised training of the encoder with high resolution but limited style images, I adopted a segmentation task to the training instead of classification. Next, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the encoder, I designed a novel experiment to visualize the encoder’s function using search and match, inspirited by a traditional method in Style Transfer. In addition to my project, I also contributed to another project about video interpolation by sharing insights from Style Transfer and suggested two methods to highlight the structure of an image and improve the ability of the network, and both of them have increased the overall performance. 

## Education

Except my endeavor in research, I tried my best in curriculum in order to make myself well equipped to become a researcher, and the past two years have witnessed the surge of my GPA: increase more than 0.2 every year, from 3.57 to 4.03 (ranking from 30% to 5%), with a National Scholarship last year. With a certain target, I have achieved what I have never expected before. I did especially well in my major courses of Automation(all above 90), and thus developed interest in applied math and cyber-physical system. Those courses helped me to understand the importance and beauty of linear algebra and other advanced mathematics, and I took countless weekends to made myself well acquainted with them.
